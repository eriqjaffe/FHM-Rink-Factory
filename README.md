# FHM Rink Factory

An Electron-based dekstop app allowing users to make custom rinks for [Franchise Hockey  Manager](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/franchise-hockey-manager-home/).

# Installation notes

Because I'm not a registered developer with Apple, macOS may block the app for security reasons (not a bad thing for it to do, ultimately).  If this happens, just CTRL-click on the app and choose "Open" from the menu - that will bring up a slightly different version of the security message with an option to open the app.  You *should* only have to do that once and macOS should store an exception for the app going forward.

Similarly, Windows might pop up a "Windows protected your PC" message when you try to run the installer.  If that happens, just click "More info" and "Run anyway".
